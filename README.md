C-Sharp-XNA-RTS_Game-Project
============================

A real-time-strategy-type project.

This is a real-time-strategy prototype that I wrote when I was trying to learn C# around 2010-2011.

The project includes the following modules:
- My own implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.
- An advanced and reasonably optimized line-of-sight visibility-tracker module.
- Tile-based terrain with zooming (a little bit broken in the current version that I have posted).
- Basic state-based AI.
- Collision dectection.
